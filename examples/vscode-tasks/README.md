## VS Code configuration example

This example defines `.vscode/tasks.json` file which instructs **VS Code** how to extract errors from the webpack's output
to display them in the **Problems** tab. It uses [TypeScript + Webpack Problem Matchers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.tsl-problem-matcher) 
provided by @eamodio :heart:

> Tip: You can use the npm type tasks even with yarn if you set "npm.packageManager": "yarn" in your VS Code settings
